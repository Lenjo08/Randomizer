Here random booleans are utilized to give output either heads or tails.

2: Roll die
Here a random output is given in the integral range 1(inlusive) to 6(inclsive).

3: Pick card 
Here output is given in for of a card from a standard 52 card set, implemented using separate arrays for the suit and face value of the card.

This was built as a sort of "hello world", an introduction to basic kotlin concepts.
